v0.7 - 29 June 2008

Made compatible with gcc 4.3, courtesy of Peter Alfredsen, loki_val at 
gentoo dot org.

v0.6 - 27 May 2008

Added check for nf_conntrack_netlink.  Fixed silly crash when run by 
non-root.

0.5 tarball was made with "make gz", didn't include a bunch of necessary 
files, and was thus totally useless.  Oops.  I'll tar it manually until 
that's fixed.

v0.5 - 7 May 2008

Interface/documentation tweaks.  Fixed compilation warnings.  Fixed i486 
sleep bug (and general kludge).  Started using autoconf.  Fixed compilation
error with gcc 4.3.

v0.4 - 7 March 2007

Implemented the -m and -c options.  Changed the values of NO_MATCH and 
NO_MATCH_YET to 1 and 2, respectively.

Made install location configurable.

Changed around the way that ./configure looks for libraries, since the old
way wasn't working for some people.

v0.3 - 25 Jan 2007

Added man page.

Added ./configure to check for libraries.

Made patterns directory user selectable.

Counts all packets now, not just those with application layer data.  I 
think this is better because it avoids holding connections forever if 
they keep sending empty packets.  On the other hand, now connections can 
evade l7-filter by sending a bunch of empty packets at the beginning. 
Perhaps a more complex approach may be necessary at some point.

Made number of packets user selectable.  Defaults to 10 (not 8).

Organized pattern file parsing code better.

Made buffer length user selectable.  Made buffer dynamically allocated.  
It is now only kept when needed instead of for the whole life of the 
connection.  Buffer is dumped to the screen (if in verbose mode) when 
(1) too many packets have passed without a match or (2) connection is 
closed without a match.

Now checks for ip_conntrack_netlink module.

Various tweaks.

v0.2 - 9 Jan 2007

Makefile now has dependencies and stuff.

Removed forced case insensitivity.  Implemented extended pattern files.  
Case sensitivity is now the default, but can be overridden with the 
"userspace flags" line in pattern files.

Can now select the queue number.  Configuration file is now specified 
after "-f" instead of being bare.

v0.1 - 7 Dec 2006

Initial release.  TCP and UDP mostly work. Initial UDP packets are 
missed. Not a lot of features yet.
